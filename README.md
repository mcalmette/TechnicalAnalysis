# Stock Technical Analysis :chart_with_upwards_trend:

Dear Recruiter: Thank you for taking the time to consider my application. If you would like
to check out the project for yourself, follow the instructions below - if not, scroll to the 
bottom to see screenshots and a gif of how it works! :grin:


## Usage: Python 3.8/Pandas/MatPlotLib


In terminal or in a Python IDE terminal, type: 
```
git clone https://github.com/mcalmette/TechnicalAnalysis.git
```

To ensure that Python3 is installed:
```
python3 --version
```

### Installations:
```
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install mplcursors
```


Now you can run main.py with the given csv files (MSFT, PFE, T, SPY). 

To add different stock data, go to yahoo finance and download a stocks csv file with a date range. Include the SPY 
csv file with the same date range (recommend 1 year/ 3 year/ 5 year), and add this to the techncial analysis folder.
